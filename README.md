## Project objectives
Current project it has been designed as final project of the subject **Digital Electronics 2** at Brno University Of Technology.

The main purpose of the project is program security software for door lock system based on Arduino.

Door lock system is divided in several hardware modules, such as:

- [x] 1. ATMega328P microcontroller
- [x] 2. Keypad
- [x] 3. LCD screen
- [x] 4. Speaker
- [x] 5. LEDs

In the following lines it will be explain different functions of this modules and their relation with complete system:

- **AMega328P microcontroller**
This module is similar to the microcontroller we have used for the semester. You can find the datasheet ['*on this link*']http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATmega48A-PA-88A-PA-168A-PA-328-P-DS-DS40002061B.pdf.
